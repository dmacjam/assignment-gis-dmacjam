# Overview - Find your perfect school

The application shows schools in UK on a map. Most important features are:
- ordering by proximity from selected location
- search by school name
- search by school type (Universities, Free schools, Academies, Colleges) or by education phase (Nursery, Primary, Secondary)
- schools have different marker colors based on school type and education phase
- get crimes near school by crime type and shows them on the map
- get undesired locations (bars, pubs, casinos, ...) nearby school

Application *Find your perfect school* in action:

The application has 2 distinct parts, which are part of this Express.js project. The client, which is a [frontend web application](#frontend) using [angular.js](https://angularjs.org/), mapbox API, mapbox.js
and the [backend application](#backend) written in [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/), backed by PostGIS. The frontend application communicates with backend using a [REST API](#api). Express.js dependencies can be found in the `package.json`.

# Frontend

The frontend application is a static HTML page (`public/html/index.html`), which shows a mapbox.js widget.
There is every school in the UK on the map. Map style is based on OSM Bright 2 and it is modified to better highlight rails stations.

All html tags (angular.js directives) from `index.html` can be found in the `public/js/directives.js`. Frontend code responsibilities are:
- displaying the sidebar panel with school list and school detail
- calling the backend API (all API calls are in `public/js/services.js` ), formatting the data
- displaying geo features by overlaying the map with a feature layer, the geojson is provided by backend APIs, styling the markers
(code in `public/js/utils.js`)

# Backend

The backend application is written in Express.js and is responsible for querying geo data, formatting the geojson and data for the sidebar panel. API functions can be found in `routes` directory with their API paths in `app.js` in root directory.

## Data

I downloaded an extent covering whole [Great Britain](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/great-britain.html) (around 780MB) and imported it using the osm2pgsql tool into the standard OSM schema in WGS 84 (espg 4326).
[Education.gov.uk](http://www.education.gov.uk/edubase/home.xhtml) is publishing open data of all UK schools.
I downloaded records of all 43 836 UK schools it in csv file and load it into a database table `schools`. School locations in the csv file
are in the UK northing, easting formatting, so I converted them to WGS84(lat,long).
UK police publish [criminality data in the UK](https://data.police.uk/about/) on a monthly basis divided by police force regions.
I downloaded data from August 2015 which contains 509 020 crime records with anonymised latitude, longitude locations.

To speedup the queries I created an index on geometry column (way) and geography column (geog) in all tables. For schools
I added indexes also to name, est_type and est_phase columns, which are used for searching and filtering.
GeoJSON is generated by using a standard st_asgeojson function, however some postprocessing is necessary
(in `routes/api.js`) in order to merge all schools or crimes into a single geojson.

## Api

**Find schools in proximity to coordinates, filter by education type or phase. Sorted by proximity.**

`GET /api/schools/identifylat=51.505&lon=0.06&phase=0`

`GET /api/schools/identifylat=51.505&lon=0.06&type=1`

`` returns array containing school objects``

**Find crimes near school by school id. Returns crimes data with crimes locations in geojson and crime statistics by crime type**

``GET /api/crimes/identify?schoolId=126585``

```

      {
         "crimetype":"Criminal damage and arson",
         "counts":"23"
      }
   ]
}
```

**Find undesired locations near school by school id. Returns location type with location in geojson.**

``GET dangers/identify?schoolId=126585``

```
[
   {
      "amenity":"pub",
      "geojson":"{\"type\":\"Point\",\"coordinates\":[0.0735691,51.4818071]}"
   },

      "amenity":"bar",
      "geojson":"{\"type\":\"Point\",\"coordinates\":[0.069644,51.4908978]}"
   }
]
```
